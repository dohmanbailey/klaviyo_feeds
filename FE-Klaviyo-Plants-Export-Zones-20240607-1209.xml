		<Title>Sweet Tea™ Gardenia</Title>
		<baileyDescription>This cross between Double Mint and Pinwheel™ produced a plant with the best features of both parents. With tennis ball sized double flowers and excellent cold hardiness this heavy rebloomer has elegant, densely scented ?owers. At 3-5’ tall and wide, Sweet Tea™ is more upright and larger than Double Mint. It is also more winter hardy. In 2013-2014 this selection survived 4-6°F in an above ground container with no injury. That’s saying something since many other gardenias suffered severe damage during the same winter. Bred by Plant Introductions, Inc.</baileyDescription>

		<Title>Tianshan® Seven-son flower</Title>
		<baileyDescription>While bred in France, this new cultivar is named after the mountain range in China where the species is native. Clusters of fragrant, creamy-white flowers appear in late summer, with each whorl containing 7 flowers. The blooms are followed in autumn by unusual purplish-red fruits. What makes this variety unique is its compact habit, growing only 8-12’, spreading only 5-7’. This small plant is well branched and forms a rounded, upright shrub or small tree with dark green shiny foliage that turns yellow in late fall. Exfoliating bark is very attractive in the winter. Use as a feature plant or as an informal hedge.</baileyDescription>

		<Title>Berry White® Panicle Hydrangea</Title>
		<baileyDescription>This long-awaited introduction is a step forward in paniculata breeding. With strong, upright stems and large cone-shaped flower panicles that stay upright, this plant is a summer stunner. Like the other paniculatas from Mr. Renault at Pépinières Renault, the flower color starts out white in July then progresses to dark pink. Coloring occurs from the bottom and progresses to the top of the panicle. Berry White® blooms a little later than Strawberry Sundae® and about the same time as Vanilla Strawberry™. Color shades can vary according to location, climate and type of soil. Our growers like this plant, and we think you will, too. (CPBR 6046), ®CA</baileyDescription>

		<baileyDescription>This variety has abundant, long lasting, rounded flower heads that start white and progress to pink, intense raspberry red and finally wine red. Flowers start blooming in July and take on red coloration earlier in the season than other pink paniculatas. Flower color is best in the fall when night temperatures are 10 degrees cooler than day temperatures. Compared to Strawberry Sundae®, Diamond Rouge® is slightly bigger and has distinct raspberry-red flowers that color earlier in the season. Benefits from multiple prunes in production to produce strong stems. Flower color varies based on climate and growing conditions. Bred by Jean Renault in France. (CPBRAF, ®CA)</baileyDescription>

Flowers emerge creamy white in midsummer, change to pink as the night temperatures drop and finally turn strawberry red.

		<Title>Fireside® Ninebark</Title>
		<baileyDescription>We selected this new ninebark because of the stunning foliage. Reddish new growth matures to deep red-purple foliage that holds its color reliably all summer, which we have witnessed in our trials in Georgia and other test sites. Add to that, Fireside™ doesn’t show any signs of powdery mildew in the field or in production. The leaf size is intermediate; bigger than Little Devil™ but smaller than Diabolo®. Pinkish-white flowers bloom in spring and foliage turns deep purple in fall. The plant habit is tidier than other Physocarpus with a rounded, upright shape.

		<baileyDescription>This improved ninebark has an upright spreading habit and fine textured, dark foliage that sets it apart from other ninebark. It is also mildew-resistant and low maintenance as it needs little to no pruning and is free from pest and disease issues and adapts to wet or dry soil. Clusters of small purplish-white flowers in June contrast nicely with the burgundy foliage. Little Devil is a good substitute for barberry in areas of the country where barberry may be invasive.

		<Title>Matcha Ball® Ash Leaf Spirea</Title>
		<baileyDescription>Matcha Ball® forms a perfect round ball of pretty fern-like foliage in a fresh shade of green. (That green color reminded us of Matcha tea, thus the name.) When the foliage first emerges in very early spring there is a hint of color in the leaves and petioles that ranges from red to orange-peach in color, ultimately maturing to green. Unlike Sem, Matcha Ball®  sparsely blooms and doesn’t develop suckers so it maintains a tight round form throughout the growing season. Fall color is yellow. Prefers moist, well-drained organic soil. Tolerates full sun to some light shade. Discovered by Denis Levac of Québec, Canada.</baileyDescription>

White flowers in spring make way to the unusual dark tan to light brown fruit, tasting like a cross between apple and pear, with crisp texture. Asian pear cultivars are partially self-fruitful but better crops are set where two or more cultivars are planted together. European pears or Asian pears, such as 'Seckel', 'Bos'c or 'Bartlett', can be used for pollination. Excellent for fresh eating or canning.

		<Title>Jade Parade® Sand Cherry</Title>
		<baileyDescription>We see this as a plant that may give landscapers a fresh perspective on mass planting groundcovers, and as an alternative to Gro-Low sumac. The foliage is an attractive glossy blueish-green, turning shades of yellow, orange, and red in the fall. Jade Parade® has a spreading habit, but rather than just creeping along the ground, the branches arch upwards. The bonus in spring is the small ½” white blooms that flower profusely along the stems and are followed by small black cherries in late summer. Very tolerant of full sun and dry conditions once established.</baileyDescription>

It is similar in size to Little Giant but has better foliage density giving it a more formal look. The foliage takes on bronze tones in colder climates. Like our other new Thuja introductions, Planet Earth™ was bred in Georgia and grows very well there. Happily, it doesn't mind cold winters, surviving -33°F in January 2019 without any burn. The same winter-damaged other selections of Thuja occidentalis, some severely. Resistant to Passalora/Cercospora needle blight. Bred by Dr. John Ruter at the University of Georgia.]]></baileyDescription>
